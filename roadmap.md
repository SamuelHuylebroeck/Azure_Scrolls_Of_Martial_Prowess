# Problems to tackle/features to add

- Improve visual lay-out
- Improved Character Creation and insertion
- Saving and loading combats and characters

# Small improvements:
- Allow ripling bashing and lethal damage assignment: numerical counter that will add and push back damage on the health track, instead of having to manually update each part of the track
